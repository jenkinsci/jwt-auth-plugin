<div>
  An accessible URL to the <code>jwks.json</code> document that should contain all valid signing keys of the upstream system.

  <p>
    Normally this resides somewhere in the <code>.well-known</code> space but can differ in many ways.<br />
    Examples are: <code>https://auth-server/.well-known/jwks.json</code>
  </p>

  <p>
    Please be aware that if you <strong>don't</strong> provide a JWKS URL, no signature verification will be performed.
    This is useful for use cases that use JWT but don't sign them.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is strongly recommended that you sign your JWTs and verify their signatures using JWKS.

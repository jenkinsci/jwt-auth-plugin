<div>
  An accessible URL to the <code>jwks.json</code> document that should contain all valid signing keys of the upstream system.

  <p>
    Normally this resides somewhere in the <code>.well-known</code> space but can differ in many ways.<br />
    Examples are: <code>https://auth-server/.well-known/jwks.json</code>
  </p>

  <p>
    If left unset, and the environment variable <code>JENKINS_JWT_AUTH_JWKSFILE</code> is set to a valid file path, the
    signing keys will be read from this file.
  </p> 

  <p>
    Please be aware that if you <strong>don't</strong> provide a JWKS URL, and you <strong>don't</strong> provide a JWKS file,
    no signature verification will be performed. This is useful for use cases that use JWT but don't sign them.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is strongly recommended that you sign your JWTs and verify their signatures using JWKS.
